Instructions to Run Owl AI App
1️⃣ Download & Prepare the Project
•	Download the Owl_AI_Project.zip file from Google Drive or GitHub.
•	Unzip it to a folder on your computer.

2️⃣ Open Terminal
•	Open VS Code Terminal or Command Prompt.
•	Navigate to the project folder:
cd "C:\path\to\Owl_AI_Project"
Replace "C:\path\to\" with your actual folder location.

3️⃣ (Optional) Create Virtual Environment
•	Recommended to avoid conflicts with other Python packages:
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
•	Terminal should show (venv) at the start.
•	If PowerShell blocks activation, run:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
.\venv\Scripts\activate

4️⃣ Install Dependencies
•	Install all required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
•	This installs Streamlit and any other dependencies.

5️⃣ Run the App
•	Start the Streamlit app:
streamlit run owl_ai_app.py
•	A browser window will open automatically at:
http://localhost:8501
•	Your Owl AI interface is ready to use.

6️⃣ Stop the App
•	When finished, press CTRL + C in the terminal to stop the Streamlit server.

7️⃣ Notes
•	Always run streamlit run owl_ai_app.py from the terminal, not inside Python (>>>).
•	If Streamlit is not recognized, make sure Python and pip are installed and you have activated your virtual environment.
