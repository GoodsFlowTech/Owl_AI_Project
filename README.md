# ðŸ¦‰ Owl AI â€“ Python Streamlit Web App

Owl AI is a simple interactive web application built using Python and Streamlit. The app allows users to ask questions or type commands and select from multiple modes such as Explain, Summarize, Translate, Joke, or Advice. Based on the input, Owl AI provides instant responses, demonstrating a Python developerâ€™s ability to create a web-based interface and handle user interactions effectively. The project showcases basic Python programming, web app development, and the use of Streamlit for building interactive UIs.

To run the app, unzip the project folder, open a terminal in the folder, and (optionally) create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv` and activate it. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run the app using `streamlit run owl_ai_app.py`. The app will open in the default browser at `http://localhost:8501`. This setup is beginner-friendly and demonstrates how to build and run a small Python web application locally.
